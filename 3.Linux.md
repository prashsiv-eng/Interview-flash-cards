# DAC
Users have direct control over access to their own data. Users can assign access rights to other users, and resource owners can restrict access based on user identity. DAC is easier to implement and maintain, but it's less secure than MAC. DAC is often used in industries where users need more flexibility and control over access rights. 
# MAC
System administrators or software developers control access decisions. Access is restricted based on the clearance of the subjects. MAC is more secure than DAC, but it's more difficult to implement and maintain. MAC is often used in military and government environments, where strict data confidentiality is required. 

# SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)

## Overview
- SELinux is a security architecture integrated into the Linux kernel.
- It provides a mechanism for supporting access control security policies.

## Key Concepts
- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**: Unlike discretionary access control (DAC), MAC restricts the ability of users to access or modify objects based on policies.
- **Policies**: Define how processes and users can interact with files, network ports, and other resources.
- **Contexts**: Labels assigned to files, processes, and ports that determine their access permissions.

## Modes
- **Enforcing**: SELinux policy is enforced, and access is denied based on policy rules.
- **Permissive**: SELinux policy is not enforced, but violations are logged for auditing.
- **Disabled**: SELinux is turned off.

## Commands
- `sestatus`: Check the current status of SELinux.
- `getenforce`: Display the current mode of SELinux.
- `setenforce [Enforcing|Permissive]`: Change the mode of SELinux.
- `chcon`: Change the SELinux context of a file.
- `semanage`: Manage SELinux policy components.
- `restorecon`: Restore default SELinux context for files.

## Tips
- Always test in Permissive mode before switching to Enforcing.
- Use `audit2allow` to generate custom policies from audit logs.
- Regularly check logs (`/var/log/audit/audit.log`) for SELinux denials.

## Common Issues
- **Permission Denied**: Often caused by incorrect SELinux context.
- **Context Mismatch**: Use `restorecon` to fix context issues.

# cgroups (Control Groups)

## Overview
- cgroups is a Linux kernel feature that limits, accounts for, and isolates the resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc.) of a collection of processes.

## Key Concepts
- **Subsystems**: Also known as controllers, these are modules that control specific resources such as CPU, memory, and I/O.
- **Hierarchy**: A tree-like structure where each node represents a cgroup and can have child cgroups.
- **Tasks**: Processes that are assigned to cgroups to control their resource usage.

## Common Subsystems
- **cpu**: Limits CPU usage for tasks in a cgroup.
- **memory**: Limits memory usage and can trigger actions when limits are reached.
- **blkio**: Controls and monitors disk I/O.
- **cpuset**: Assigns CPUs and memory nodes to tasks in a cgroup.

## Commands
- `cgcreate`: Create a new cgroup.
- `cgdelete`: Delete an existing cgroup.
- `cgset`: Set the parameters of a cgroup.
- `cgget`: Get the parameters of a cgroup.
- `cgexec`: Execute a task in a specific cgroup.
- `cgclassify`: Move existing tasks to a specific cgroup.

## Tips
- Use `systemd` to manage cgroups on modern Linux distributions.
- Monitor resource usage with `cgtop` or `systemd-cgtop`.
- Combine cgroups with namespaces for more effective containerization.

## Common Issues
- **Resource Starvation**: Incorrect configuration can lead to resource starvation for critical processes.
- **Complexity**: Managing multiple cgroups and hierarchies can become complex.
