# Cryptographic Algorithms and Protocols: An Overview

Cryptography forms the backbone of secure communication and data protection in the digital world. Below is an overview of key cryptographic paradigms, their advantages, disadvantages, and applications.

## Symmetric Cryptography

**Description**:  
Symmetric cryptography uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. Both the sender and recipient share this secret key securely.


**Example**:  
Bob encrypts a message using a shared key. Alice decrypts it using the same key.

**Advantages**:
- **Speed**: Faster and computationally efficient.
- **Efficiency**: Suitable for encrypting large amounts of data.

**Disadvantages**:
1. **Key Exchange Problem**: Securely sharing the key over insecure channels is challenging.
2. **Trust Dependency**: Both parties must trust each other to keep the key secure.
3. **No Authentication**: Does not verify the sender's identity, lacking non-repudiation and integrity.

### Block Cipher Algorithms:
- **DES**: Operates with a 64-bit block size.
- **3DES**: Enhances DES security by applying encryption three times.
- **AES**: Supports key sizes of 128bits(10 rounds), 192bits(12 rounds), and 256bits(14 rounds) bits.

**Modes of Operation**:
1. **ECB (Electronic Codebook)**: Simple but prone to pattern leaks.
   * weakest mode. Shouldn't be used. 
   * it lacks diffusion, meaning that identical plaintext blocks will always result in identical ciphertext blocks leading to inference attacks.
2. **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)**: Links blocks for better security.
   * Depends on previous cipher text. If one block of cipher text is corrupted, it will proggress to all future blocks.
   * vulnerable to padding oracle attack

3. **CTR (Counter Mode)**: Supports parallel processing.
   * Overcomes the disadvantage of CBC by encrypting a counter and XOR with plain text block
   * Disadvantage - Doesn't have integrity check (Bit flipping attacks)

4. **GCM (Galois Counter Mode)**: Combines encryption with integrity. (GMAC)
   * IV is 96 bits + counter is 32 bits = 128bit block. 
   * IV should be truly random (entropy)

### Stream cipher Algorithms
- **RC4**: A modern symmetric-key stream cipher used in wireless networks and SSL protocols. It was developed in 1987 by Ron Rivest, who also helped create the RSA public-key cipher. While RC4 is still used, it has many known vulnerabilities. 
- **A5/1**: A stream cipher used for voice encryption in GSM mobile phones. 
- **ChaCha20**: A modified version of Salsa20 that is supported in TLS 1.3. 
- **LILI-128**: A stream cipher with a 128-bit key that is resistant to known attacks. It is easy to implement in software or hardware.

## Asymmetric Cryptography

**Description**:  
Asymmetric cryptography uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

**Example**:  
Bob encrypts a message using Alice's public key. Only Alice can decrypt it using her private key.

**Advantages**:
1. **No Key Exchange Risks**: Public keys can be shared openly.
2. **Authentication**: Ensures the sender's authenticity and provides non-repudiation.

**Disadvantages**:
1. **Slower**: Computationally intensive compared to symmetric cryptography.
2. **PKI Requirement**: Needs a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing keys and certificates.
**Examples**
### RSA (Communitative)
based on mathematial logic that it is very difficult to factorize the product of two large prime numbers. 
Prime number : Divisible by 1 and itself
semi prime: factors are 1 and prime numbers (when you multiply 2 prime numbers)
- Select 2 prime numners P,Q
- Calculate N=P*Q
- Totient T =(P-1)*(Q-1)
- Public Key (E):

      - Should be prime
      - should be less than T
      - Should not be a factor of T
- Private Key (D)
   - must satisfy (D*E) Mod T = 1
- Encrption (Message M)
  - **M^E Mod N = C**
- Decryption
   - C^D Mod N = M
### Deffie-Helman
based on descrete logrithm problem G^X Mod P = N
- Agree on 2 numbers P(prime) and G(generator)
- generate private numbers (X)
- share public (N) = (G^X)MOD P on both sides
- key =(public^private) Mod P


**Applications**:
- **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**: Ensures secure web communication.
  - **Key Exchange**: ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral).
  - **Authentication**: ECDSA or RSA (e.g., RSA-2048 or higher).
  - **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM.
  - **Hashing**: SHA-256 or SHA-384.
---
### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
PKI manages digital certificates and public-private key pairs. 
- Certification Authorities (CAs) validate public keys and issue certificates to establish trust.
X.509 certificate
- Online Certificate status protocol (OCSP) : protocol to query if certificate is revoked
- Certificate revocation list (CRL)
- Registration authority(RA): Enterprises can request certificate from RA 
- chain of trust
- Software defined perimeter - Pinned certificates, IP in common name,

## Message Integrity and Authentication
### Message Authentication Code (MAC)
- **Purpose**: Verifies message integrity using a symmetric key.
- **Algorithms**: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256.
   - MD5 and SHA-1 are prone to collision attack
### Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
- **Purpose**: Enhances MAC by combining the message with a secret key before hashing.
- **Formula**: `hash(o_key_pad || hash(i_key_pad || message))`

**Advantages**:
- More secure than standard MAC.
- Resistant to tampering due to the use of a key.

**Disadvantages**:
- Cannot authenticate the sender or provide non-repudiation.

## Digital Signatures

**Description**:  
Digital signatures ensure integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.  
- The sender generates a message digest using a hash function.
- The digest is encrypted with the sender's private key.

**Verification**:  
The recipient uses the sender's public key to decrypt the digest and compares it with a new hash of the message.

## Password Storage
- Use a strong password hashing algorithm like Argon2, PBKDF2, or Bcrypt.
- Generate a unique salt for each password and store it along with the hashed password.
- Choose a reputable and widely-used library like bcrypt (Node.js), passlib (Python), or jBCrypt (Java).
- Store the hashed password and salt in a secure database or storage solution.
- Limit access to the stored passwords to only those who need it.
- Enforce strong password policies - Length, password rotation, mix of alphanumeric and special characters etc.
- password reset, MFA, initial user onboarding


## TLS
TLS 1..3 favors simplicity and security over backwards compatibility. Major cchange is in the handshake. Some Weak cipher suites have been deprecated.

A **cipher suite** is a combination of cryptographic algorithms used to secure network communications, particularly in protocols like SSL/TLS. It defines the set of algorithms that determine how different aspects of a secure connection will be handled, including encryption, key exchange, and integrity checking. A cipher suite typically includes the following components:


1. **Key Exchange Algorithm**: This algorithm determines how the parties involved in the communication will securely exchange keys for encryption. Examples include:
   - **RSA** (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
   - **ECDHE** (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral)
   - **DH** (Diffie-Hellman)

2. **Authentication Algorithm**: This algorithm ensures that the identity of the communicating parties is verified. Typically, this is combined with the key exchange algorithm. Examples include:
   - **RSA**
   - **ECDSA** (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)

3. **Bulk Encryption Algorithm**: This algorithm defines how the data will be encrypted during transmission. Examples include:
   - **AES** (Advanced Encryption Standard) with different key sizes (128, 256)
   - **ChaCha20**

4. **Message Authentication Code (MAC) Algorithm**: This algorithm ensures the integrity of the data and verifies that it has not been tampered with during transit. Examples include:
   - **SHA-256**
   - **SHA-384**



### Example Cipher Suite:

**Example Cipher Suite**:  
`TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`

A cipher suite like **TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256** breaks down as:
- **ECDHE**: Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (key exchange)
- **RSA**: RSA (authentication)
- **AES_128_GCM**: AES encryption with a 128-bit key in Galois/Counter Mode (encryption)
- **SHA256**: SHA-256 (hashing)

Each cipher suite defines how a secure connection will be established, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, and its choice impacts the security and performance of the connection. Modern systems often use AES for encryption and SHA-256 for integrity, as they are both considered secure and efficient.
